# repair-app
This is a Repair App that my family could use for their landscape business

This repo uses yarn which is a new package manager that works in concert with npm. with yarn the dependencies are more accurately tracked to insure that the same version of the package is installed on every machine.

I am using a google API key for my access to google maps. I have currently deactivated the current key and will regenerate one when I need a new one.
    - if you wish to use your own key feel free to replace mine with yours.
